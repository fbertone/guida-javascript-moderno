# 04 - Webpack, React, and Hot Module Replacement

Code for this chapter available [here](https://github.com/verekia/js-stack-walkthrough/tree/master/04-webpack-react-hmr).

## Webpack

> 💡 **[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)** is a *module bundler*. It takes a whole bunch of various source files, processes them, and assembles them into one (usually) JavaScript file called a bundle, which is the only file your client will execute.

Let's create some very basic *hello world* and bundle it with Webpack.

- In `src/shared/config.js`, add the following constants:

```js
export const WDS_PORT = 7000

export const APP_CONTAINER_CLASS = 'js-app'
export const APP_CONTAINER_SELECTOR = `.${APP_CONTAINER_CLASS}`
```

- Create an `src/client/index.js` file containing:

```js
import 'babel-polyfill'

import { APP_CONTAINER_SELECTOR } from '../shared/config'

document.querySelector(APP_CONTAINER_SELECTOR).innerHTML = '<h1>Hello Webpack!</h1>'
```

If you want to use some of the most recent ES features in your client code, like `Promise`s, you need to include the [Babel Polyfill](https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/polyfill/) before anything else in in your bundle.

- Run `yarn add babel-polyfill`

If you run ESLint on this file, it will complain about `document` being undefined.

- Add the following to `env` in your `.eslintrc.json` to allow the use of `window` and `document`:

```json
"env": {
  "browser": true,
  "jest": true
}
```

Alright, we now need to bundle this ES6 client app into an ES5 bundle.

- Create a `webpack.config.babel.js` file containing:

```js
// @flow

import path from 'path'

import { WDS_PORT } from './src/shared/config'
import { isProd } from './src/shared/util'

export default {
  entry: [
    './src/client',
  ],
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist/js'),
    publicPath: `http://localhost:${WDS_PORT}/dist/js/`,
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      { test: /\.(js|jsx)$/, use: 'babel-loader', exclude: /node_modules/ },
    ],
  },
  devtool: isProd ? false : 'source-map',
  resolve: {
    extensions: ['.js', '.jsx'],
  },
  devServer: {
    port: WDS_PORT,
  },
}
```

This file is used to describe how our bundle should be assembled: `entry` is the starting point of our app, `output.filename` is the name of the bundle to generate, `output.path` and `output.publicPath` describe the destination folder and URL. We put the bundle in a `dist` folder, which will contain things that are generated automatically (unlike the declarative CSS we created earlier which lives in `public`). `module.rules` is where you tell Webpack to apply some treatment to some type of files. Here we say that we want all `.js` and `.jsx` (for React) files except the ones in `node_modules` to go through something called `babel-loader`. We also want these two extensions to `resolve`. Finally, we declare a port for Webpack Dev Server.

**Note**: The `.babel.js` extension is a Webpack feature to apply our Babel transformations to this config file.

`babel-loader` is a plugin for Webpack that transpiles your code just like we've been doing since the beginning of this tutorial. The only difference is that this time, the code will end up running in the browser instead of your server.

- Run `yarn add --dev webpack webpack-dev-server babel-core babel-loader`

`babel-core` is a peer-dependency of `babel-loader`, so we installed it as well.

- Add `/dist/` to your `.gitignore`

### Tasks update

In development mode, we are going to use `webpack-dev-server` to take advantage of Hot Module Reloading (later in this chapter), and in production we'll simply use `webpack` to generate bundles. In both cases, the `--progress` flag is useful to display additional information when Webpack is compiling your files. In production, we'll also pass the `-p` flag to `webpack` to minify our code, and the `NODE_ENV` variable set to `production`.

Let's update our `scripts` to implement all this, and improve some other tasks as well:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "yarn dev:start",
  "dev:start": "nodemon -e js,jsx --ignore lib --ignore dist --exec babel-node src/server",
  "dev:wds": "webpack-dev-server --progress",
  "prod:build": "rimraf lib dist && babel src -d lib --ignore .test.js && cross-env NODE_ENV=production webpack -p --progress",
  "prod:start": "cross-env NODE_ENV=production pm2 start lib/server && pm2 logs",
  "prod:stop": "pm2 delete all",
  "lint": "eslint src webpack.config.babel.js --ext .js,.jsx",
  "test": "yarn lint && flow && jest --coverage",
  "precommit": "yarn test",
  "prepush": "yarn test && yarn prod:build"
},
```

In `dev:start` we explicitly declare file extensions to monitor, `.js` and `.jsx`, and add `dist` in the ignored directories.

We created a separate `lint` task and added `webpack.config.babel.js` to the files to lint.

- Next, let's create the container for our app in `src/server/render-app.js`, and include the bundle that will be generated:

```js
// @flow

import { APP_CONTAINER_CLASS, STATIC_PATH, WDS_PORT } from '../shared/config'
import { isProd } from '../shared/util'

const renderApp = (title: string) =>
`<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>${title}</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="${STATIC_PATH}/css/style.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="${APP_CONTAINER_CLASS}"></div>
    <script src="${isProd ? STATIC_PATH : `http://localhost:${WDS_PORT}/dist`}/js/bundle.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
`

export default renderApp
```

Depending on the environment we're in, we'll include either the Webpack Dev Server bundle, or the production bundle. Note that the path to Webpack Dev Server's bundle is *virtual*, `dist/js/bundle.js` is not actually read from your hard drive in development mode. It's also necessary to give Webpack Dev Server a different port than your main web port.

- Finally, in `src/server/index.js`, tweak your `console.log` message like so:

```js
console.log(`Server running on port ${WEB_PORT} ${isProd ? '(production)' :
  '(development).\nKeep "yarn dev:wds" running in an other terminal'}.`)
```

That will give other developers a hint about what to do if they try to just run `yarn start` without Webpack Dev Server.

Alright that was a lot of changes, let's see if everything works as expected:

🏁 Run `yarn start` in a terminal. Open an other terminal tab or window, and run `yarn dev:wds` in it. Once Webpack Dev Server is done generating the bundle and its sourcemaps (which should both be ~600kB files) and both processes hang in your terminals, open `http://localhost:8000/` and you should see "Hello Webpack!". Open your Chrome console, and under the Source tab, check which files are included. You should only see `static/css/style.css` under `localhost:8000/`, and have all your ES6 source files under `webpack://./src`. That means sourcemaps are working. In your editor, in `src/client/index.js`, try changing `Hello Webpack!` into any other string. As you save the file, Webpack Dev Server in your terminal should generate a new bundle and the Chrome tab should reload automatically.

- Kill the previous processes in your terminals with Ctrl+C, then run `yarn prod:build`, and then `yarn prod:start`. Open `http://localhost:8000/` and you should still see "Hello Webpack!". In the Source tab of the Chrome console, you should this time find `static/js/bundle.js` under `localhost:8000/`, but no `webpack://` sources. Click on `bundle.js` to make sure it is minified. Run `yarn prod:stop`.

Good job, I know this was quite dense. You deserve a break! The next section is easier.

**Note**: I would recommend to have at least 3 terminals open, one for your Express server, one for the Webpack Dev Server, and one for Git, tests, and general commands like installing packages with `yarn`. Ideally, you should split your terminal screen in multiple panes to see them all.

## React

> 💡 **[React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)** is a library for building user interfaces by Facebook. It uses the **[JSX](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html)** syntax to represent HTML elements and components while leveraging the power of JavaScript.

In this section we are going to render some text using React and JSX.

First, let's install React and ReactDOM:

- Run `yarn add react react-dom`

Rename your `src/client/index.js` file into `src/client/index.jsx` and write some React code in it:

```js
// @flow

import 'babel-polyfill'

import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'

import App from './app'
import { APP_CONTAINER_SELECTOR } from '../shared/config'

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.querySelector(APP_CONTAINER_SELECTOR))
```

- Create a `src/client/app.jsx` file containing:

```js
// @flow

import React from 'react'

const App = () => <h1>Hello React!</h1>

export default App
```

Since we use the JSX syntax here, we have to tell Babel that it needs to transform it as well.

- Run `yarn add --dev babel-preset-react` and add `react` to your `.babelrc` file like so:

```json
{
  "presets": [
    "env",
    "flow",
    "react"
  ]
}
```

🏁 Run `yarn start` and `yarn dev:wds` and hit `http://localhost:8000`. You should see "Hello React!".

Now try changing the text in `src/client/app.jsx` to something else. Webpack Dev Server should reload the page automatically, which is pretty neat, but we are going to make it even better.

## Hot Module Replacement

> 💡 **[Hot Module Replacement](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/hot-module-replacement/)** (*HMR*) is a powerful Webpack feature to replace a module on the fly without reloading the entire page.

To make HMR work with React, we are going to need to tweak a few things.

- Run `yarn add react-hot-loader@next`

- Edit your `webpack.config.babel.js` like so:

```js
import webpack from 'webpack'
// [...]
entry: [
  'react-hot-loader/patch',
  './src/client',
],
// [...]
devServer: {
  port: WDS_PORT,
  hot: true,
},
plugins: [
  new webpack.optimize.OccurrenceOrderPlugin(),
  new webpack.HotModuleReplacementPlugin(),
  new webpack.NamedModulesPlugin(),
  new webpack.NoEmitOnErrorsPlugin(),
],
```

- Edit your `src/client/index.jsx` file:

```js
// @flow

import 'babel-polyfill'

import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import { AppContainer } from 'react-hot-loader'

import App from './app'
import { APP_CONTAINER_SELECTOR } from '../shared/config'

const rootEl = document.querySelector(APP_CONTAINER_SELECTOR)

const wrapApp = AppComponent =>
  <AppContainer>
    <AppComponent />
  </AppContainer>

ReactDOM.render(wrapApp(App), rootEl)

if (module.hot) {
  // flow-disable-next-line
  module.hot.accept('./app', () => {
    // eslint-disable-next-line global-require
    const NextApp = require('./app').default
    ReactDOM.render(wrapApp(NextApp), rootEl)
  })
}
```

We need to make our `App` a child of `react-hot-loader`'s `AppContainer`, and we need to `require` the next version of our `App` when hot-reloading. To make this  process clean and DRY, we create a little `wrapApp` function that we use in both places it needs to render `App`. Feel free to move the `eslint-disable global-require` to the top of the file to make this more readable.

🏁 Restart your `yarn dev:wds` process if it was still running. Open `localhost:8000`. In the Console tab, you should see some logs about HMR. Go ahead and change something in `src/client/app.jsx` and your changes should be reflected in your browser after a few seconds, without any full-page reload!
